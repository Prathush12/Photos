# Stock Photos Directory

Place 5-10 stock photos in this directory. The photos will be automatically loaded under the "stock" user in the "stock" album when the application starts.

## Supported Formats
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- BMP

## Notes
- Use low to medium resolution images to keep the repository size manageable
- The photos should be actual image files, not just placeholders
- The application will read the file modification date as the "date taken" for each photo
