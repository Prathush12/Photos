# How to Add Stock Photos

The download script didn't work, so you'll need to add stock photos manually.

## Option 1: Use Your Own Photos
1. Find 5-10 photos on your computer (or download free ones)
2. Copy them to the `data/` directory
3. Make sure they're JPG, PNG, GIF, or BMP format
4. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 1MB each is good)

## Option 2: Download Free Stock Photos
Go to these sites and download 5-10 free stock photos:
- https://unsplash.com (free, no attribution required)
- https://pexels.com (free stock photos)
- https://pixabay.com (free images)

Download them and save to the `data/` directory.

## Option 3: Use System Wallpapers (Mac)
If you're on Mac, you can copy system wallpapers:
```bash
cp /System/Library/Desktop\ Pictures/*.heic data/
# Then convert to JPG if needed
```

## What You Need
- 5-10 image files
- Formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, or .bmp
- Place them in the `data/` directory
- The app will automatically load them when you login as "stock"

## After Adding Photos
1. Restart the application
2. Login as "stock"
3. You should see the photos in the "stock" album
